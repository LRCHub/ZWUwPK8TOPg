I closed the door, she stole the key
Gave her pearls, I washed her feet
I said, "My love", she was asleep
Dreaming of other things~~~~~~~~QA: Scanned~~~~~~~
She goin', she goin', she goin', she goin', she goin', she goin'
She goin' to turn the light out
Close, close your eyes, boy, let it be
She goin', she goin', she goin', she goin', she goin', she goin'
She goin' to turn the light out
Time is out on me
Carry on in restless peace
That we belong, we long to be
Inside someone, inside of me
And all my wrong be left at sea
She goin', she goin', she goin', she goin', she goin', she goin'
She goin' to turn the light out
And just close your eyes, boy, let it be
She goin', she goin', she goin', she goin', she goin', she goin'
She goin' to turn the light out
Time is out on me
She goin', she goin', she goin', she goin', she goin', she goin'
She goin' to turn the light out
Just close your eyes, boy, let it be
She goin', she goin', she goin', she goin', she goin', she goin'
She goin' to turn the light out
Time is out, time is out on me
