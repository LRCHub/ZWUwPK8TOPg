How can I tell you that I can't stay here anymore?
Something has ended and that's a fact I can't ignore

'Cause love is changing like the seasons, changing like the tides
It's somehow like the days turn into nights
And even if I could still love you, it wouldn't be the same
'Cause like the tides my love has changed again

How can I tell you I've never meant to hurt you so?
Oh please believe me I am not proud of what I do

But nothing lasts forever, that is something you should know
It's always hard to realize but that's the way things go

'Cause love is changing like the seasons, changing like the tides
It's somehow like the days turn into nights
And even if I could still love you, it wouldn't be the same
'Cause like the tides my love has changed again
