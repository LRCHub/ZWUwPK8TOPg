I can hear the wild waves break
This island of bone
Below the swell the stars are waking
No matter how much I shake
i'm gonna find home
Though I've been overtaken
By the tides of the moon
I'm swimming against
The tides of moon
You'll hear from me yet
I'll get to you soon
Savage cities on my trail
Won't leave me alone
Terrorize the song I'm veiling
Even though my arms are frail
I'm gonna find home
You know my faith ain't failing
'Lo the tides of moon
I'm swimming against
The tides of moon
I'll get to you yet
You'll hear from me soon
Follow every wave that traces my name
You know
That I have been detained
And I feel I could die
Swimming against
The tides of moon
You'll hear from me yet
I'll get to you soon
Swimming against
The tides of moon
You'll hear from me yet
I'll get to you
Get to you, oh...
